Visual Studio Code is arguably the most popular code editor for web developers currently. I discovered VS Code back in college when I was doing freelance work on the side. Previously I used Notepad++, Sublime Text, and finally Brackets. Those editors were fine for me when I was starting out, but as soon as I started freelancing, it became evident to me that I needed something more powerful.

Before I switched to Linux, I was heavily coding in C#, and using Visual Studio (the IDE). I was a fan of the overall experience of coding in a Visual Studio IDE. The UI is sleek and modern. So naturally, when I found out they also had a code editor under the Visual Studio brand, I had to try it. I immediately fell in love with how easy it was to use and the amount of themes and plugins that are accessible to me.

Recently, they also added the *settings sync* feature. VS Code logs in to your Github account and syncs your code editor's settings across multiple devices. This helped me greatly during the transition from a work-from-home setup to an office-based work. I just installed VS Code on the machine I had in the office, signed in with my Github account, and it started syncing. All of my settings, themes, and extensions are automatically installed and configured. As soon as all of the packages were downloaded, I could start coding. I did not need to configure anything myself.
