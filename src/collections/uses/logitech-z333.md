Since Lady Gaga's [Chromatica](https://open.spotify.com/album/05c49JgPmL4Uz2ZeqRx5SP?si=EMjXxR5pQ9mHwLtZCr1uQg&utm_source=copy-link) album dropped in 2020, I have always wanted to have a speaker that supports surround sound to experience the album in all of its glory. In 2021, I was able to buy the Logitech Z333 2.1 Multimedia Speaker System. It makes listening to songs heavy with bass so satisfying. It supports surround sound becase of its two-speaker system, and it has a subwoofer.

I do not know anything much about speakers and sound systems. Mostly I just buy whatever other people tell me that works. And I am just delighted that Logitech Z333 is very easy to set up. It comes with RCA jacks for the two speakers, and a power cable. I just connected the speakers to the subwoofer, connected the subwoofer to my computer via a 3.5 mm jack plug, and plugged it into the power strip. It just worked, and it works flawlessly.

I also liked the fact that it comes with a very conveniently sized volume knob that can be placed on my desk. It acts not just as a volume knob but also as a headphone jack I can plug my earphones in whenever I want to listen to music in private or I have a call incoming. The knob also houses the power switch, so I can easily turn the speaker off as soon as I am done using it. The earphones still work, by the way, even with the switch turned off.

And I also got it for a very affordable price. I got it (at the time) for around ₱1,999 during a Shopee sale. It normally retails for ₱2,950. I think it is a good price, considering how loud and crisp it can be.
