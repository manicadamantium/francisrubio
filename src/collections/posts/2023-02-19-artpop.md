Lady Gaga has arguably cemented her name not just in the music industry, but also in pop culture history. Her art has been mostly polarizing and controversial for the more conservative world of 2009, and largely influential and inspirational for the generation of artists that came after her and grew up with her music. At the time of writing, she has ventured into acting in films and TV series, with her notable roles as the Countess in American Horror Story, and Ally in the hit remake A Star Is Born, winning her both a Golden Globe and an Oscar respectively.

Since her debut in 2008, Lady Gaga has been a force to be reckoned with, until her 4th studio album <i>ARTPOP</i> was released. Up until then, Lady Gaga is in every chart, newspaper, paparazzi photos, and in the eyes of the public. But it seemed that the general public got tired of her as soon as she released her most experimental project yet. What happened?

## “What is ARTPOP?”

To understand what ARTPOP is, we have to first understand its roots in <dfn>pop art</dfn>. During the mid to late 1950s, pop art was an art movement that challenged the traditions of fine art by incorporating imagery from pop culture. As opposed to classical art like the ones Da Vinci and the like put out, pop art included advertisements, comic books, celebrities, and mundane mass-produced objects into the art. One artwork that Lady Gaga frequently referenced was Andy Warhol's <cite>Campbell's Soup Cans</cite> from around 1961 to 1962. Pop art found beauty in the mundanity of things, and its aesthetic was just as much an art as the ones in fine art are.

ARTPOP is <q>a reverse Warholian experience</q> as Gaga put it. She said that ARTPOP was the dream of putting art and pop together, but with art in the front. It was an endeavor to have art influence pop culture, as opposed to pop art where pop culture influences the art. Throughout the album cycle, Lady Gaga, as the beacon of pop culture as she was at the time, let herself become the canvas. She let herself, the personification of pop culture, first become influenced by art, and later become art itself.

In her first music video, Applause, released in 2013, Lady Gaga embodied Venus, the goddess of love, from Sandro Botticelli's painting <cite>The Birth of Venus</cite>. In a later performance at the Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga came out as her alter ego Venus in front of 10 million viwers. By taking from an art piece to create another, Lady Gaga has put art in the front of pop culture when she brought Sandro Botticelli's art in the pop culture scene with her music video.

At its heart, ARTPOP is a <b>subversion of expectation</b> and <b>creative rebellion</b>. ARTPOP is shocking, which is exactly what Gaga does best, and rebellious in that it didn't care about the trends at the time. It was unapologetic, raw, and unique.

## Music

By the time ARTPOP released, Electronic Dance Music (<abbr>EDM</abbr>) is already on its way out. Some fans think that Lady Gaga was innovative in that she's using a genre that people weren't listening to, but in reality, I think, pop music at that point was moving in a different direction, and Gaga just picked EDM as the vessel with which to create her record. She doesn't try to follow the trends after all.

But subversion of expectation and creative rebellion still permeates through all of the tracks in the album. It is not new to her fans that Lady Gaga writes lyrics about trauma and darkness and wraps them in beats that make you dance. ARTPOP is where she used it a lot. Track #8, Swine, is a hyperpop track that talks about the feeling of disgust a sexual assault victim feels about themselves and their assailant. The sound incorporates heavy and fast-paced beats as if the instruments were played by someone furious. The lyrics talk about a rapist who is a person who is "just an animal, tryna act real special", "a pig inside a human body."

Donatella, track #9, pays homage to her good friend and a well-known fashion personality Donatella Versace. It is a cheek-in-tongue track that glorifies fashion and people in fashion while also calling out ridiculous systems that run the fashion industry. "Tailor these clothes to fit your guilt," Gaga writes, as rich people often use fashion statements to evoke messages to the general public and to mask issues they don't want anyone talking about. The lyrics even talk about how fashion models "just had a salad today" to keep their slim figures. It also pokes fun at one of her looks in the past by telling the listeners to "just ask your gay friends their advice before you get a spray tan."

Track #3, G.U.Y, talks about being the submissive one in a relationship. The track is highly sexual in nature because it talks about how being the submissive one gives a person the most power in a relationship. It evokes the "no one rules if no one obeys" idea, and how her lovers won't have any more power over her than how much she gives them. The title is an initialism for "Girl under you" which is also a pun, since men often dominates heterosexual relationships. She also says "please retweet" because at the time, the retweet button in Twitter looked like the number 69, which is a euphemism for oral sex. The song also makes a lot of references to Greco-Roman mythology, mentioning Mars, the god of war, as another euphemism for sex.

Track #7, the title track ARTPOP, talks about Lady Gaga's dream of art and pop coming together. In the ethereal-sounding song, she talks about ‘undressing art's glamour and cruelty,’ criticizing its failures and praising its glory. It also talks about how “the color palette you choose can profit you,” referencing how artistic choices can make or break an artist's work and career. Of course, she, of all people, knows how it is, seeing that her career has depended on the color palettes she chose through the years. According to her, “ARTPOP could mean anything,” it can be interpreted in many different ways by different people with different experiences. In fact, she claims that ARTPOP is not new, and people before her have done it already, and she's just referencing them in this record.
## Performances

Lady Gaga's first performance in the ARTPOP era was her lead single [Applause at the 2013 Video Music Awards](https://youtu.be/_M3UuqoV0To). During this performance, she solidifies her vision of herself as being both the canvas and the art itself. Throughout her performance, she changed from a stylized outfit depicting a blank canvas to various fashion she wore throughout her career to communicate her changing nature and how she has become a personification of pop culture. By ending the performance as Venus from Botticelli's painting, she communicated that the art was simultaneously the finished piece (Lady Gaga as Venus), the process through which she became the piece (her transformation through the years), and the artist herself (Lady Gaga as the artist).

</figure>

This concept of the artist being both the canvas and the art itself is further developed in a very controversial performance later on. Lady Gaga performed a track from the album called [Swine in SXSW](https://youtu.be/q-8R24KvTUE). This track describes the disgust and anger of a victim after a sexual assault. The lyric "you're just a pig inside a human body" perfectly encapsulates how a sexual assault victim sees their assailant. And in her SXSW performance, Lady Gaga creates a poignant visual by making vomit artist Millie Brown vomit out green paint on her body while riding a mechanical bull. In this performance, Gaga is once again both the canvas and the art itself—her clean body defiled by a rapist, and the resulting repugnant visual of her covered in vomit becomes an art installation commenting on the experiences of sexual asssault victims and how they see themselves after the assault.

During this era, Lady Gaga also frequently references prior art to drive home her reverse Warholian expedition concept by elevating pop culture as high art and at the same time putting high art at the forefront of pop culture. In another Applause performance, Lady Gaga dressed up as Dorothy and Glinda the Good from the Wizard of Oz, one of the earliest films that used Technicolor technology to showcase color film towards the end of the black-and-white era of movies. When Lady Gaga landed on Greece during the album cycle, she created a [performance coming out of the airport](https://youtu.be/GZwfmjHZfo4) dressed as the goddess Aphrodite with her dancers performing alongside her. She also dresed up as an animé character for her [Japan performance](https://youtu.be/9tUa_2AkdSw).
