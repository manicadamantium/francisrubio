I keep writing under the lens of my previous experiences as a former member of Jehovah's Witnesses. One of the most important doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses is neutrality in all forms of political conflicts, regardless of size and importance. It has long been taught by the religious organization that neutrality means that one keeps their loyalty to the only true government, what they see as the coming Kingdom of God under the rule of Jesus Christ himself. According to their teachings, this Kingdom, an actual operating government, has already been ruling the heavens since 1914, and will come to restore peace on earth anytime now by way of Armageddon, the war to end all wars.

But as the result of the most recent national level elections here in the Philippines, does this neutrality actually takes a strong foothold when held against the morals that everyone, not just religious people, have? 

## The Current Landscape of the Elections

As someone who works in the tech industry, being a web developer myself, most of my dealings with politics reside in the spaces provided in social media. And from this vantage point, we see that the conflict that has been brooding between supporters of different candidates, specifically of presumptive president-elect Bongbong Marcos and incumbent Vice President Leni Robredo, has just gotten a step more intense, with the supporters of Bongbong taking every opportunity to mock the other group with the victory that they are currently getting, and supporters of Leni retaliating as they grieve with their current loss in the elections.

The elections have been marred by a long list of problems that could potentially be a precursor to a declaration of a failure of elections. Vote counting machines (<abbr>VCM</abbr>) in many precincts have broken down. Voters have been advised to either leave their ballots behind for a later batch processing, or to wait until new VCMs arrive. In one place, the elections have been disrupted by an alleged paid instigator who tore the ballots before voters could cast their votes; that alleged instigator has been killed by a raged mob. Several reports online have shown policemen, who have nothing to do with the electoral paraphernalia, tearing the ballots up as the voting closed when the policy has prohibited them from doing so. And despite all of this, a quick transmission of partial and unofficial vote counts has been received by the Commission on Elections (<abbr>COMELEC</abbr>) in just less than 3 hours after the voting has closed.

In this current state of affairs, discussions are not only heated but scorching. Everyone is going for the jugular with what they think is right. And for those who are neutral, all they could do is turn a blind eye and pretend that things will turn out for the best.

## The Morality Involved

The Marcos family has been proven to be corrupt, murderers, and plunderers. This has been supported by several court cases won by the people of the Philippines not just here but also in other countries.
