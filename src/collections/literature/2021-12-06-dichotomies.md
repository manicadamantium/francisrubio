if i were to steal a glance on the rear-view mirror and take myself back to my past, dichotomies seem to litter the dirt pavement, hiding under the nooks and crannies of each crevice in the cracked unfertile ground.

they were all i've ever known. and you, my love, know that better than anyone. i've always lived in molds, conforming to the expectations that have been imposed upon me by my own blood who ironically cared the least of how it might have affected me. and in turn, inside my mind despising and blaming them, but also myself because i wasn't strong enough to say no.

until you let me in and ride with you.

i finally feel like i'm moving forward. and i now have a reason to look and be excited for the drive ahead. unlike anyone who i've ever been with, you let me decide the pace at which we travel. always checking in if you're going too fast or if i'm ready for more. you gave me a taste of freedom in our small pocket of reality, and even if it's far from a fairy tale happy ending, i've never found myself happier than i have today.

and as my eyes travel to the roads closer to our present, something's changed. the roads are less rough, balanced, and smooth. it's no longer dirt, it's asphalt. where vehicles are meant to go, as if i'm where i should be.

and because you've offered me an escape from the relentless sameness, the sullen repetitive prison cell i was jailed in, you've simultaneously driven me towards the land of the hopeful unknown, where risks aren't something to be afraid of but something to embrace.

and because of you the next time i'll steal a glance in the rear-view mirror, it's no longer that painful wretched dichotomoy i'll see, it'll be blissful stability â€” what i've been unkowingly thirsting for my whole life.
