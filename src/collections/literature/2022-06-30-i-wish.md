I wish I received more love when I was younger.<br>
I wish I had more friends<br>
I wish I didn't get a religion<br>
So I learned kindness through love instead

I wish more people cared<br>
When I was alone and my mother dead<br>
Because all of who I became<br>
Would be different had someone been there

I lament over the things robbed from me<br>
By the world too complacent to care<br>
I grieve over the youth I lost<br>
When I had to grow fast just to be here

I wish people cared enough<br>
To move them to reach out<br>
Too exhausted to form connections<br>
Too burnt out to keep the fires alive

I wish I was more than who I was<br>
More than having no money<br>
More than just having a potential<br>
To be more than who I am

I wish things were just ever so slightly<br>
Different than all of what have been<br>
Because now people would love me more<br>
If only I wasn't who I am
