One fact that most Filipinos overlook is the fact that in the Filipino alphabet, <i>ng</i> is a single letter, not two. It's how we represent the <i>/ŋ/</i> (voiced velar nasal) sound.

Also, if you think a letter was needlessly included in the Filipino alphabet, it's probably because it's used in a local language you don't know about. We're mostly using "foreign" letters like <i>Z</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>V</i>, and <i>F</i> for proper nouns, but there are local languages that actually use these letters natively, and to them, these are not borrowed from western orthographies.

This is also why I don't agree when people define Filipino as just standardized Tagalog. Maybe that would've been true at one point, but the orthography we have is actually inclusive of all languages in the country.

[@abolisyonista](https://masto.ai/@abolisyonista@ni.hil.ist) raises an issue about this though.

> What's frustrating is that it used to be rendered as ng̃ to denote a special letter but this was dropped sometime in the first half of the 20th century. It's frustrating to me because ñ is an important part of Spanish culture and it's even part of the logo of Institutio Cervantes, but Philippine orthography casually dropped ng̃ which is sad.

I find this really interesting because this is the first time I'm hearing of this. At first I thought that this tilde over the <i>g</i> was removed for practical reasons. Considering how much of a struggle it is to write ñ in typed documents, maybe it was seen fit to just remove the tilde on <i>ng</i> since people recognized it as a single phoneme anyway. At least this is my speculation, as I cannot find a source on why it was removed in the first place.
