<p>Before anyone misconstrues this blog post, I am not saying that frameworks are bad. I'm just saying that what these frameworks are doing is doable by hand to some extent, and that I like doing that because that's just me.</p><p>Also, this post is from someone who hasn't touched ReactJS or Vue in, like, ever, so take it with a spoon of salt at least.</p>
