Pinoy Websites is a web ring for Filipino-owned personal websites. A web ring is a collection of sites that share a common attribute (in this case, owned by a Filipino) that link to each other to increase discoverability for people who visit. It was popular in the 90s and early 2000s before social media was a thing.
